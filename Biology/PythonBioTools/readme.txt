PUNNET SQUARE CALCULATOR
I created this one night to help me through the genetics portion of my biology class because I did not want to go 
through doing all the punnet squares in my lab; I also heard I would need to be doing punnett square in genetics. 

SETUP:
If you aren't into computers and just want to check your bio or genetics homework on a school night.
I'll try and make this guide as cut and paste as I can. 
  ON MAC:
  1.) Download the file
  2.) Save it to Documents 
  3.) press "Command and Shift" type "terminal" then press enter
  4.) Type "cd" in the terminal press enter. 
  5.) Type "cd Documents" in the terminal and press enter. 
  6.) Type "python PunnettSquareCalculator.py" in the terminal and press enter: it should start to run now
  
  ON WINDOWS: **If you have python intalled 
  1.) Download the file 
  2.) Navigate to the file and click on it t run it. 
  
HOW IT WORKS: 
Upon Running It will ask you to place your parent alleles in. 
After you do so it will generate a list of combinations and the genotypic ratio.
Best if used under 8 pairs of alleles.
